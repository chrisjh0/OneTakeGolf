Welcome to One Take Golf!

This game is similar to mini-golf, but with a twist: you have to get a hole in one on each level!

Instructions:
- Click and drag on the white ball, the farther you drag back, the faster and further the ball will go!
- Warning: if the ball is moving too fast when coming in contact with the hole, it will speed right over it!
- Go for the hole in one!

However, there are obstacles along the way:
- Sand slows the ball down.
- Ice removes friction.
- Lava ends the game immediately!

Other things to note:
- The ball starts at the rainbow tile.
- The hole is the tile that looks like the hole.
